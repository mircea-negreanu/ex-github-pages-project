For the moment Flower Platform (server, both v1 and v2) can be compiled from source code (available on our [GitHub repository] (https://github.com/flower-platform/)).

We'll have binary distributions available starting with Flower Platform v2.

The plugin version for Eclipse (& other IDEs) will be available later/soon. See [roadmap] (roadmap.html) for details.
