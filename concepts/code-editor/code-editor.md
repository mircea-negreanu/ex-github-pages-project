When working with Flower Platform from a web browser or mobile, we may need to access the code:

* either in read mode: browse source files that have the syntax highlighted
* or in write mode: e.g. write comments, snippets of code or pseudo-code during a collaboration session

Flower Platform supports basic editor operation: create file, open file, save file.

It would be nice to integrate an existing web based editor. E.g. :

* <http://brackets.io/>
* <http://ajaxorg.github.io/ace/>
* The editor used by <http://www.eclipse.org/orion/>

The advantage is that we could reused a lot of editor-related features that don't exist in the current version of Flower Platform
