Flower Platform was initially an Eclipse plugin. Then it was "promoted" to a server product (Eclipse based as well) with advanced features such as real-time collaboration.

Flower Platform 2.* will be available as an Eclipse plugin as well. Feature highlights:
* super fast. 
* workflow designed to work together with Flower Platform server, to allow collaboration directly from IDE.  

<!-- label:ideas -->
Flower Platform 2.* could be embeded in other IDEs, such as NetBeans, Idea, etc.
