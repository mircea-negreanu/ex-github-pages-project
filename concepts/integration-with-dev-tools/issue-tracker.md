{% include JB/setup %}

Flower Platform (server) will integrate with the following issue trackers:

* [GitHub] (https://github.com/features/projects/issues)

The data from issue trackers will be shown on [mindmap diagrams] (../mindmap-diagrams).

<!-- label:ideas -->
Support additional issue trackers:
* [Redmine] (http://www.redmine.org)
* [JIRA] (http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
* [Trac] (http://trac.edgewall.org/)
* [Bugzilla] (http://www.bugzilla.org/)
* etc.

<!-- label:ideas -->
Flower Platform might show data from issue trackers (i.e. issues) on Gantt diagrams as well. Depending on the issue tracker API, we might see on a Gantt diagram:
* the issues with time related details (planned start, end, actual start, end)
* work logs
* relations between issues (blocked by, precedes, etc.)
