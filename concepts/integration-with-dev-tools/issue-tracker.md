{% include JB/setup %}

Flower Platform (server) will integrate with the following issue trackers:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/features/projects/issues)

The data from issue trackers will be shown on [mindmap diagrams](../mindmap-diagrams).

<!-- label:ideas -->

Support additional issue trackers:

* [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org)
* [JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
* [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/)
* [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/)
* etc.

Flower Platform might show data from issue trackers (i.e. issues) on Gantt diagrams as well. Depending on the issue tracker API, we might see on a Gantt diagram:

* the issues with time related details (planned start, end, actual start, end)
* work logs
* relations between issues (blocked by, precedes, etc.)
