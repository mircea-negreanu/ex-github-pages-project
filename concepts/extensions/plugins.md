Flower Platform is based on Eclipse and OSGi (i.e. Equinox implementation from Eclipse). All the logic of Flower Platform is organized in plugins that declare extension points to allow other plugins to register and contribute with custom logic.

This way it's straight forward to contribute new plugins. E.g. to support a new language, a new wiki, a new kind of editor (for the web & mobile), etc.
