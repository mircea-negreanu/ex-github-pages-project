<div markdown="1" class="clearfix">
A mobile client for Android and iOS.

The platform makes it easy for extensions to expose most of their features on mobile,  using **single sourcing** (i.e. same client code runs in the web and mobile environment). 

The client side code (using [Apache Flex](http://flex.apache.org/) and JavaScript) runs on mobile using the [Adobe AIR](http://www.adobe.com/products/air.html) technology.
