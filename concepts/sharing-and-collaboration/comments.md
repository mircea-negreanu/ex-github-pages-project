Real time collaboration sometimes is not enough; because contributors on a project (especially on open-source projects) are not available at the same time (e.g. because of time zones, work schedule, etc.).

Users will be able to add comments and have discussions on diagrams. Somehow similar to the discussion mechanism of this web site. People would post comments, reply to comments, etc. A comment or discussion will be linked to one item (or perhaps several items) from the diagram. So when we select an item on the diagram, we'll see the discussions attached to that particular item.
