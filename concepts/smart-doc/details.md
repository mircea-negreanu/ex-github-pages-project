Now the user has seen a demo and he has made the first steps on his projects/code/etc.

He can now look at all the details of a feature. As he reads the small pieces of doc, he marks them as "read". Flower Platform will remember, per user, which are the items read and not yet read. This way, when a new Flower Platform version is released, he will be invited to take a look at the improvements.
