The Properties view displays available properties for the selected node. To enable this view, use the **Properties** action.

<img class="img-thumbnail" src="properties4.png"/>
<img class="img-thumbnail" src="properties3.png" hspace="20"/>
</p>

Properties that can be edited have a **Change** checkbox next to them. If the default property value is changed, the checkbox becomes selected. Deselecting the checkbox, will restore the default value for that property.
