## Context
**Flower Platform** is a web based diagramming software, with a strong focus on source code. Users can create diagrams (UML-like):
* which are **synchronized** with the actual source code (e.g. from Git, SVN),
* on which they **collaborate** in real-time.
 
## News 
 
<div>
<p>
<strong>#1.</strong> <a href="http://www.crispico.com">Crispico</a> <strong>open sources Flower Platform</strong>, under GPL v3. 
Flower Platform is an open software starting from now, with an open diagramming/modeling language. 
The community will dictate (and contribute) which are the features they need, specific to their workflows, programming languages and tools. 
</p>

<p>A dual licensing system will be made available by <a href="http://www.crispico.com">Crispico</a>. 
I.e. the code will be available both under GPL v3 license and a commercial license, so that users can chose the licensing model that is more convenient for them. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>#2.</strong>The Flower Platform team we'll be showing at the Flower Platform OSCON booth a <strong>sneak peek/demo</strong> of some of the 
new and pioneering features of Flower Platform v2 (which is currently under development):
<ul>
<li>Diagrams and code on tablet and mobile.</li>
<li>Smart structure diagrams: a new kind of diagram that combines a structure (or class) diagram and flow (interactions between code) on the same diagram.</li>
<li>Mindmap diagrams that synchronize data toward external tools (e.g. wiki, issue tracker).</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
<strong>#3.</strong>The Flower Platform <strong>web site</strong> has been rebuilt. The new <a href="http://flower-platform.org">flower-platform.org</a> is, first of all,
a <strong>communication platform</strong> between the <strong>community</strong> and the Flower Platform team (and vice-versa as well). 
E.g. the section <a href="/concepts">Concepts + Discussions = Features</a> shows in the same place:</p>

</div>

* what Flower Platform **does**, right now;
* what Flower Platform **will do**, in the future, according to the developments that are planned;
* **ideas** about what Flower Platform should do;
* and **discussions** around the points above.

## Flower Platform at OSCON 2013

The developers of Flower Platform are looking forward to meet people and discuss on the following topics:

* Sharing ideas about how diagramming can help open-source communities.
* Learning more about the programming languages, the tools and the workflows used within open-source communities.
* Identifying new needs, where new features can add value, adapted to the specifics of various technologies used by open-source communities. 

<div>
<p>
<span class="label label-success">The Flower Platform philosophy:</span> It is Flower Platform that should adapt to what the developers do and how they do it. 
And not the opposite! I.e. it is Flower Platform that should adapt to their programming languages (OOP or not!), their tools (IDE, Version Control, Issue Tracker, wiki, etc.) 
and their workflows.

## Background

### Flower Platform

**Flower Platform v1** was released October 23, 2012 (the first alpha version). The product was initially named "Flower Dev Center", but has been
renamed to "Flower Platform", as the team thinks it describes better the characteristics of the product.

**Notable features** of Flower Platform:
* Import source code from Git and SVN
* Create models and diagrams (UML/class diagrams like), based on source code
* Advanced code synchronization technology (named "CodeSync") that limits the possibility of conflicts when modifying the diagrams and code at the same time
* CodeSync markers on diagram elements: see clearly the synchronization status of each element    
* Real time collaboration between users, on diagrams
* Real time collaboration between users, on text files, with syntax highlighting
* Management of organizations, users and groups, featuring a powerful and flexible mission system
* Code navigation (Eclipse like: CTRL+SHIFT+R to find a resource by name/filter, CTRL + click within a source file, etc.)

Since March 11, 2013, the Flower Platform team is working actively on the next major version **Flower Platform v2**. 
**Notable features** that are currently being worked on (some of them will be demonstrated at OSCON):
* support for tablet and mobile devices
* support for more programming languages: e.g. Python, JavaScript. Investigations and discussions are held regarding the possibility of supporting functional programming
languages (e.g. Scala, Clojure)
* bi-directional data synchronization towards other kind of tools (beside code source): wiki, issue tracker, code review
* mindmap diagrams
* smart structure diagrams: diagrams that combine structure (files, classes, functions) + the interractions / flow between them
* IDE plugins

### Crispico

[Crispico] (http://www.crispico.com) (full name: Crispico Resonate MP4 SRL), based in Romania, branch of the [Resonate MP4 Group] (http://www.resonate-mp4.com)
(based in France) has been founded in 2005, and specializes in building 
mission critical software for the airport business.

The know-how acquired from the "tranches" made Crispico focus on modeling, diagramming and other means of optimizing the day-to-day development flow. Crispico thinks that
the tools that currently exist on the market (open-source or commercial) are not sufficiently calibrated on Crispico's needs. I.e. optimize communication between developers, 
help build better architecture while being fast and **WITHOUT** adding burden to the development workflow. This is the context that gave birth to Flower Platform.
