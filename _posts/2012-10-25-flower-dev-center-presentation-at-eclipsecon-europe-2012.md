This year at [EclipseCon Europe 2012](http://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2012/), Cristian gave a talk about the newest product of the Flower Platform: Flower Dev Center, and showed how it can be used by open source developers. We have recorded both the live performance and the screen(s), and we have combined them into the video below.

Enjoy!
