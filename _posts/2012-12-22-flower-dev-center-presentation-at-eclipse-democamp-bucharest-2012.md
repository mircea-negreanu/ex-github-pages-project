We have presented Flower Dev Center at the Eclipse DemoCamp event, held in Bucharest, on November 28, 2012. We have recorded the presentation and we have uploaded it on YouTube.

The content of the presentation is basically the same as in our presentation at EclipseCon Europe 2012. The ECE 2012 recording is a little bit shorter (about 7 mins) and a little bit more concise.

This one is a little bit longer (about 12 mins), as we tried to make it more funny. We simulated modeling of an application that may be really useful in the real life: management of calls and SMS messages that come from mother in laws. :-)
