We have upgraded Flower Dev Center (flower_dev_center_demo_playground). This new version contains:

* Improved performance for SVN operations
* Editors react to external changes done on open resources (e.g. revert)
* Revert & Repair actions for model elements
* When all users disconnect from a resource without saving them (e.g. connection lost): the resource will be automatically saved, so that modifications are not lost
* Bug fixes
