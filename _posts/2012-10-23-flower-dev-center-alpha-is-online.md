We are proud to announce that we Flower Dev Center (alpha version: 1.0.0_2012-10-23_alpha_6364) is online. In the next days we'll periodically update the version, containing fixes for problems that we (or you) find. We'll publish as well some doc & tutorials.

For the moment there is a read/write access for everyone + anonymous login activated.

We are looking forward to receiving feedback.
