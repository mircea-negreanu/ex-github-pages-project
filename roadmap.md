It features a technology that we call CodeSync (Flower Platform 2 contains CodeSync3 technology), a code <-> model synchronization technology that militates for a modeling language that supports language specificities. The frontend of UML4AS is web based, so the Eclipse editor embeds actually a web browser showing the UI.
